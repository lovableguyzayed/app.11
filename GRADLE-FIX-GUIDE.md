# 🔧 Gradle Repository Error - FIXED!

## ❌ **The Problem**
```
Build was configured to prefer settings repositories over project repositories 
but repository 'Google' was added by build file 'build.gradle'
```

## ✅ **The Solution**
I've fixed the Gradle configuration by:

1. **Updated `settings.gradle`**:
   - Added `repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_SETTINGS)`
   - Moved all repositories to settings level
   - Proper plugin management configuration

2. **Updated `build.gradle`**:
   - Removed conflicting repository declarations
   - Clean top-level build file
   - Only essential plugin declarations

3. **Updated `gradle.properties`**:
   - Added repository management fix
   - Optimized build performance settings

## 🚀 **Now Try Again**

1. **Close Android Studio completely**
2. **Delete these folders** (if they exist):
   ```
   android-native/.gradle/
   android-native/build/
   android-native/app/build/
   ```
3. **Reopen Android Studio**
4. **Open the `android-native` folder**
5. **Wait for Gradle sync**

## ✅ **Expected Result**
- ✅ Gradle sync completes successfully
- ✅ No repository errors
- ✅ Ready to build APK

## 🎯 **If Still Having Issues**
Try this command in terminal:
```bash
cd android-native
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

The repository configuration is now properly set up for modern Gradle versions!
